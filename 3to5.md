## 3. If you were asked to impute null values in a column of a file that was 365 Gigabytes, what would you do? What tools would you use? What tools would you NOT use?

Since Pandas is built on a C-based library that allows faster parallel processing of data, I would use its features to efficiently impute null values in the column of a file by the column's mean. I would not do this manually. I would create a Python file that reads the file into a Pandas DataFrame, count the null values in each column, examine if the values can be imputed easily by the mean (or any other appropriate value), and use the DataFrame's fillna function to impute such values.

## 4. What would you do if you were asked to do the above task every Thursday morning at 2:00am?

While I think the exact method would vary based on the operating system, I, using a Windows computer, would utilize Windows's built-in Task Scheduler to run my above Python program once a week (on Thursdays at 2:00am). The way I would do this is by creating a batch file (.bat) that executed my Python file, and then create a trigger in Windows Task Scheduler that activates weekly at the exact right time.

## 5. Who is your favorite mathematician, statistician, or computer scientist and why?

My favorite mathematician is Alan Turing, since he not only pioneered key concepts in computation and artificial intelligence, but also contributed to the World War II effort by crypto-analyzing the Enigma code, even while being unjustly prosecuted for being gay. I took a Theory of Computation class last year and got a chance to work with Turing machines and I found it not only well-understandable, but extremely powerful. It still surprises me sometimes how TMs are universal as far as modern computing goes. In addition, the Turing test has been a key indicator of the efficacy of artificial intelligence, and captured my mind pretty easily when I was young, helping me understand AI a bit more and wanting to explore machine learning as a teenager.
